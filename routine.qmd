# Routine

When you have something like cancer, you realize that whatever you were doing *when* you became sick, may have been the reason *why* you became sick. Wherever you were at physically, mentally, socially, emotionally â€“ you need to get away from that state!

Routine is the habits that set our physical, mental, social and emotional state.

I realized early on that in order to make all the changes that I needed to make, these things had to fit into a routine that I could check off each day.

Below I outline the routine and further expand on the components in later sections.
