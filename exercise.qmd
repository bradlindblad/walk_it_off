## Current protocol

### EWOT

EWOT or Exercise With Oxygen Therapy is a powerful modality. Here is what I'm doing.

There are two separate workouts that are done on alternating days, seven days a week.

#### Workout A:

*Warmup*:

-   2 minutes w/o oxygen

-   2 minutes w/ oxygen

*Sprints*

Perform 3-5 clusters of the following:

-   20 seconds all-out work, 10 seconds rest

-   Do that 3-5 times

-   Moderate pace for 2 mins

*Steady state*

-   Continue at a normal steady state until reaching 500 calories

#### Workout B:

-   Steady state cardio for 500 to 1000 calories
